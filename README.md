# Python Breakpoints
 
Originally developed for the [Halo 3 Randomizer](https://github.com/jonetiz/H3Randomizer), this C++ module provides a mechanism via [pybind11](https://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to set hardware breakpoints on another process in Python. Support for software breakpoints is work in progress and may be added at a later date.
